Well, never it’s too late for beginning new paths, and what I’m doing today is to start a new one. As I have never considered myself an expert on any topic, my idea is to expose my thoughts in posts and the value of this blog will be the comments provided by all you.

What will be this blog about? IT world topics: architecture, DevOps, Cloud, Agile, design, QA, etc. So, first of all, let me to introduce myself.

My name’s Arnau Oncins Rodríguez. I was born in 1982. I always liked science, technology and computer science. My passion for these topics led me to study [Computer Science](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en) at [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/en).

I currently live in [Montcada i Reixac](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Moncada+y+Reixach,+Barcelona/@41.5122854,2.1888156,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x12a4bc36ef2d4b05:0xc723ae6bc991f043!8m2!3d41.4870207!4d2.1880548!16zL20vMGZ5ajEy?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTExMi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). It’s a little town near Barcelona. I have many hobbies and interests. Generally, I combine my free time between family, nature and my own studies about information technology. I spend lots of hours in front of my computer at home. However, I’m the first one to join a mountain trip!

I have collaborated with some social movements in Montcada i Reixac. There are a lot of things to do and I think everybody can sum his/her contribution in his/her free time for -at least- fight for his/her ideals.

So let’s see how this evolves in the future!
